### Objective

Publishing to a topic using an ESP8266, and creating a Python script that will subscribe to this same topic, via a Raspberry Pi which will act as the MQTT Broker.

### METHODOLOGY
<ul>
<li>Basic Raspberry Pi Setup
<li>Run and install Mosquitto broker
<li> Installing Python Paho-MQTT
<li> Creating the Python Script
<li> Programming the ESP8266 using arduino
 </ul>
